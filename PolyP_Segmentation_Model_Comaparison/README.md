## 📌 Project Overview

This project compares two powerful deep learning architectures — **U-Net** (a classic CNN-based segmentation model) and **TransUNet** (a hybrid CNN + Transformer model) — for **polyp segmentation** on the **Kvasir-SEG dataset**.  

The goal is to evaluate how traditional convolutional models and transformer-augmented models perform on a small, challenging medical imaging dataset, both in terms of **accuracy** and **efficiency**.

---

## ❓ Why This Study?

Polyp detection and segmentation are critical for **early diagnosis of colorectal cancer**, one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide.  
Accurate polyp segmentation can assist clinicians during colonoscopy by highlighting suspicious regions in real-time, reducing the risk of missed polyps.  

This study was carried out to:  
- Compare a **classical CNN-based approach (U-Net)** with a **hybrid Transformer-based approach (TransUNet)**.  
- Understand how **different architectures generalize** on a small but challenging medical dataset (Kvasir-SEG).  
- Provide an open, reproducible benchmark to guide future research in **medical image segmentation**.

## ⚙️ Methodology

We trained **two models under the same experimental setup** for fairness:

### 1. Preprocessing
- Resize all images and masks to **256×256**.  
- Normalize using ImageNet mean/std.  
- Augmentations: random flips, rotations, elastic transforms, brightness/contrast jitter.  
- Dataset split: **70% train / 15% validation / 15% test**.

### 2. U-Net (Baseline CNN)
- Classic encoder-decoder with skip connections.  
- Encoder: 4 downsampling stages.  
- Loss: **Dice + BCE**.  
- Optimizer: AdamW (lr=1e-3).  
- Early stopping on validation Dice.  

### 3. TransUNet (CNN + Transformer)
- Hybrid model with ResNet/ViT encoder + U-Net style decoder.  
- CNN extracts low-level features → Transformer encoder captures long-range dependencies → Decoder upsamples with skip connections.  
- Same training settings as U-Net for fair comparison.  

### 4. Evaluation
- Metrics: **Dice Coefficient, IoU, Precision, Recall, Boundary F1 (BF-score)**.  
- Efficiency: **Params (M), FLOPs (G), Model Size (MB), CPU Latency (ms/frame)**.  
- Visuals: side-by-side **Image | Ground Truth | U-Net Prediction | TransUNet Prediction**.

### 📝 Key Observations
- **U-Net** achieved **higher training Dice (0.8934)** and slightly better **validation Dice (0.8393)**, but had higher test loss.  
- **TransUNet** converged faster (best at epoch 10) and achieved **lower test loss (0.1351)**, while Dice and IoU were very close to U-Net.  
- **Both models generalize well** with nearly identical Dice (~0.82) and IoU (~0.73) on the test set.  
- Visual comparisons show **U-Net** captures boundaries more smoothly in some cases, while **TransUNet** segments harder polyps with lower loss.

## ⚠️ Issues Faced

During this project, we encountered several challenges:

- **Small dataset size** (Kvasir-SEG has only 1,000 images), which increases the risk of overfitting.  
- **DataLoader crashes / worker killed errors** due to limited system memory when using heavy augmentations.  
- **Training instability** in some runs, especially for TransUNet, which required careful learning rate tuning and early stopping.  
- **Checkpoint compatibility issues** with PyTorch 2.6 (changes in `torch.load` defaults).  
- **Longer training times** for TransUNet compared to U-Net, even on relatively small input sizes.  

---

## 🔮 Future Work

There are several directions to extend this study:

- **Add more baselines** such as U-Net++, HarDNet-MSEG, or lightweight real-time models for edge deployment.  
- **Cross-dataset validation** (e.g., test generalization on CVC-ClinicDB or ETIS-Larib).  
- **Model compression**: pruning, quantization, or knowledge distillation to make models deployment-ready for clinical devices.  
- **Boundary-aware losses** (e.g., Boundary F1, Tversky, or Hausdorff loss) to better capture small/tiny polyps.  
- **Semi-supervised or self-supervised learning** to leverage unlabeled colonoscopy data for better feature learning.  

---

## 🏁 Final Words

This project demonstrated a **comparative study between U-Net and TransUNet** on the **Kvasir-SEG dataset** for polyp segmentation.  

- **U-Net** proved to be a strong, lightweight baseline, achieving high Dice scores with fewer parameters.  
- **TransUNet**, while heavier, showed competitive performance and converged quickly in fewer epochs.  
- Both models performed similarly on the test set, highlighting that classical CNNs remain competitive, while Transformer-based models offer promising alternatives.
